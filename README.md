# Night Owl for Sublime Text Color Scheme

This is a port of [VS Code Night Owl](https://github.com/sdras/night-owl-vscode-theme) theme adapted to Sublime Text.

This is just a color scheme, for now, not a theme. However, it fits nicely with the adaptive [DA UI](https://github.com/ihodev/sublime-da-ui) theme.

I have compared it with the VS Code original for languages such as Javascript (Babel), Python, Markdown, HTML, CSS, Pug, Ruby, Typescript, and it is quite similar, although not identical, but I am satisfied with it.

## To-Do's

- [ ] Check compatability with other languages such as Java and C/C++.
- [ ] Design a corresponding sublime theme.
- [ ] Get rid of some scopes that are applicable to VS Code, but not to Sublime.
